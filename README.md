<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Background
IKEA, a renowned multinational retailer, operates a complex sequence of processes
and activities within their Order Life Cycle (OLC), encompassing various stages from
order placement to fulfillment and delivery to the customer. However, the orders
within this complicated system are prone to imperfections which could result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales, and high costs for IKEA.
Order imperfections, as defined by the company, encompass any deviations, errors,
or issues occurring within the order processing system that result in disparities between customer expectations and the actual delivery of products. Order imperfections
can stem from different activities related to multiple sources within the OLC. These
include errors in internal processes such as packaging and delivery, supplier-related
issues like supply chain delays and product defects, and customer-related factors such
as incorrect order specifications and changes in preferences. These imperfections lead
to customer dissatisfaction, additional costs for IKEA, and the need for extra time
and resources to rectify the situation.
To mitigate the negative impact of order imperfections, there is an urgent need for
IKEA to estimate the likelihood of imperfections occurring at various stages of the
OLC. More precisely, the company plans to identify and analyze the most significant
reasons behind these imperfections, thereby enabling them to gain insights into the
key contributing factors. By detecting the crucial attributes or patterns typical of
imperfection orders, they hope to analyze the process and take preventative action.
Specifically, the solution should provide the company with the ability to recognize
and predict possible order imperfections based on the available order lifecycle logs.

## Goals and Objectives
Our projectâ€™s primary goal is to design a method/tool to estimate the likelihood of
order imperfections based on the available order life-cycle logs and detect the most
important reasons for the imperfections in the Finland market. Our objectives to
reaching the goal are:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the order lifecycle data.
2. Develop and evaluate a predictive process mining model
3. Design an explanation method for the prediction mode
